<h1>Content Search</h1>

<p>
    Text appearing in the resource content can be used to find the resource using Content
    Search feature. Simply enter the text you are looking for and click <b>Search</b>;
    resources that contain the text you entered will be listed as search results.

<p>
    Words entered by the user will be matched as whole words in the resource content. Resources
    that have one or more words entered under <b>Search For</b> above will appear in search
    results. WSO2 Governance Registry, by default, supports searching inside resources containing
    plain text, XML content (including WSDLs, Schemas, Policies, etc.), PDF files, Word documents,
    Excel documents and Power Point documents. Support for other media types can be added by adding
    new indexers. Please refer WSO2 Governance Registry User Guide for details.
</p>
<p>
    Newly added resources have to be indexed before they appear in Content Search results. This
    automatic indexing process happens in the background and therefore newly added resources might
    not be immediately available for Content Search. Indexing frequency and initial startup delay
    for indexing are configurable as described in the User Guide.
