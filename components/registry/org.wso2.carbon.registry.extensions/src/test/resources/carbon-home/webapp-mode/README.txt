Running WSO2 Carbon in Webapp mode
-------------------------------------

Standalone mode is the recommended way of running All WSO2 Carbon products. However you have the
option of running WSO2 Carbon products in Webapp mode (hosted as a web-app in an application 
server). 

1. The 'WEB-INF' directory contains the webapp archive
2. The 'bundles' directory contains the additional jars that needs, during the web-app mode
   deployment.

Please refer the WSO2 Carbon documentation for step-by-step guide on web-app mode deployment of the 
product.
